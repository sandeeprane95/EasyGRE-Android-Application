# EasyGRE-Android-Application

Current Application : 
An android application which allows the user to study new words and then take a timed test to check their updated vocabulary.

Future Work :
Future development of EasyGRE can be to include more number of words. We plan to incorporate a widely followed wordlist like the Barron's 333 or the Barron's 800 essential words. Also, adding more tests for the students would be an essential part of the development.
Another important functionality that can be added is the ability to keep a track of scores and checking the overall improvement in the vocabulary using bar-graphs or pie-charts. Finally, we would also like to make improvements on the UI for better user experience.
